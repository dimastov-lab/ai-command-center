"""MAJOR-9: the runtime report *write* path must stay under REPORTS_ROOT.

`command_center.runtime.reports.report_path_for` is a second copy of the report
path builder -- the `agent_runner` one was contained under SEC-2, this one was
not. It builds ``REPORTS_ROOT / project / f"{ts}_{id[:12]}.md"`` from a run's
``project``/``id``; an imported or hand-authored ``project`` like "../../root"
walked the write out of REPORTS_ROOT. Each user-influenced component is now
sanitized to a separator-free charset (mirrors SEC-2's fix on the sibling).

"""AICC-UI-001 remediation: every project-scoped filter, counter, ranking, and
grouping in the app must agree on which project a task belongs to, whether the
task stores the canonical `models.PROJECT_IDS` id ("AICC") or a display
name / alias ("AI Command Center"). The single source of truth is
`project_config.canonical_project_id` / `project_config.project_matches`; these
tests prove no consumer of it drifts.

Kept Streamlit-free (the end-to-end pill == lane == strip proof lives in
`tests/test_app_streamlit.py`) so the invariant is fast and unambiguous.

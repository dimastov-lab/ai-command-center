"""Domain core of the autonomous task-completion pipeline (AICC-AUTONOMY-001).

This module holds the *pure* decision logic — no subprocesses, no database, no
Streamlit — so it is exhaustively unit-testable in isolation:

  * the completion **state machine** vocabulary (`CompletionState`),
  * machine-readable **reason codes** (`ReasonCode`) and **actions**
    (`CompletionAction`),
  * the **policy** governing recovery/merge behavior (`CompletionPolicy`),
  * the **evaluator** (`CompletionEvaluator`) that maps a full evidence snapshot
    to a structured `CompletionAssessment` — never a bare boolean.

The evaluator is the single source of truth for "given everything we know about
this run, what completion state are we in and what should happen next?" The
side-effecting orchestration (running validation, pushing, opening/merging PRs,
verifying the target branch, persisting state) lives in
`runtime.completion_service`, which consults this evaluator but never
duplicates its decision rules.

Relationship to the other two state axes (documented for operators):
  * `run.state` (db.py) — the *execution* lifecycle of a Claude subprocess;
    terminal once the process exits. The completion pipeline begins only after a
    run reaches a terminal `COMPLETED` execution state.
  * `completion_state` (this module) — the *engineering* lifecycle from
    "process finished" to "merged into the target branch and verified".
  * Kanban `launch_status` (models.LAUNCH_STATUSES) — the coarse, user-facing
    projection, derived from the above by `session_view`/`task_sync`.

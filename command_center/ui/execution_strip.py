"""Execution Strip (UX-2a): a slim, always-visible status bar that surfaces
what is running right now regardless of which page is open.

It is a small, isolated polling fragment, so it polls the runtime database on its
own cadence and repaints *only itself* — the page behind it never blanks just
because the strip ticked. This is the direct answer to the operator's reported
"every few seconds the whole page visibly refreshes" pain: execution state
becomes one glance away on every page without a per-page auto-refresh.

The strip deliberately mirrors the Live Execution Center's bucket vocabulary
(``live_board``: live / waiting / attention) so an operator does not learn a
second word for the same thing here. Counts come from cheap raw-state filtering
of ``api.list_runs`` — the strip is a status glyph, not a second board, so it
does not build the full session views the Execution Center page does.

# (`runtime/db.RUN_STATES`: PREPARED, QUEUED, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED,
# CANCELLED, INTERRUPTED, UNKNOWN) — *not* from the *display* statuses that
# `session_view.derive_status` produces (Launching / Starting / Running / Stale
# / Waiting / Blocked / Incomplete / …). Those display strings are derived at
# render time and are never written to `run.state`, so filtering raw runs by
# them (the original code) matched nothing: "в очереди" was always 0, "требуют
# внимания" only ever counted FAILED.

# Mapping (aligned with `live_board._BUCKET_BY_STATUS` via
# `session_view.derive_status`):

#   INTERRUPTED, UNKNOWN → Requires Attention                          (attention)
#   COMPLETED, CANCELLED → done / operator-stopped — not surfaced in the strip.

    Kept free of Streamlit so it can be unit-tested directly. Any state outside
    the three buckets (e.g. COMPLETED/CANCELLED, or a future state added to
    ``RUN_STATES``) is intentionally ignored by the strip — the strip is a
    "what is happening *now*" glyph, not a full board. A guard below asserts the
    buckets stay consistent with ``RUN_STATES`` so a new persisted state can't
    silently drop off the strip.

    Superseded earlier attempts (a task with a newer run) are dropped by the
    caller (see ``_nonsuperseded_runs``) so the strip's attention count agrees
    with the Live Board, which filters ``live_board.superseded_run_ids`` out of
    its attention bucket — without that, a task that failed once and was retried
    would keep its old FAILED run pinned in "требуют внимания" forever even
